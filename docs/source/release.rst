Versioning
----------

demo versioning is based on `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html>`_.

And it's RPM compatible.

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

#. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
#. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner,
#. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixing.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

#. A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and an identifier immediately following the patch version.

   Identifier MUST be comprised and only with ASCII alphanumerics [0-9A-Za-z].
   Identifier MUST NOT be empty.
   Numeric identifier MUST NOT include leading zeroes.
   Pre-release versions have a lower precedence than the associated normal version.
   A pre-release version indicates that the version is unstable and might not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as denoted by its associated normal version.
   Examples: 1.0.0-alpha, 1.0.0-sprint5, 1.0.0-rc4.

#. Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch or a dot and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the pre-release version.

   Identifiers MUST be comprise and only with ASCII alphanumerics [0-9A-Za-z].
   Identifiers MUST NOT be empty.
   Build metadata SHOULD be ignored when determining version precedence.
   Thus two versions that differ only in the build metadata, have the same precedence.
   Examples: 1.0.0-12.g1234abc, 1.0.0-s5.4.g1234abc.


Release Instruction
-------------------

In practice, we use `tito` to add git tag and do release including tag based on releases and current HEAD based on test releases.

.. NOTE:: `tito` version >= 0.6.2, install guide refer to: `https://github.com/dgoodwin/tito`

A short instructions as:

#. Tag: tito tag
#. Test Build: tito build --rpm --offline
#. Push: git push origin && git push origin $TAG
#. Release: tito release copr-demo/copr-demo-test

For each step, more detail are:

Tag
```

A new git tag need to be added before starting a new release::

    $ tito tag

It will:

- bump version or release, based on which `tagger` is used, see `.tito/tito.props`;
- create an annotated git tag based on our version;
- update the spec file accordingly, generate changelog event.

For more options about `tito tag`, run `tito tag --help`.

Test Build
``````````

Once release tag is available, we can do some build tests including source tarball checking, and rpm building testing.

   ::

    # generate local source tarball
    $ tito build --tgz --offline

    # generate local rpm build
    $ tito build --rpm --offline

If everything goes well, you could push your commit and tag to remote, otherwise the tag need to be undo::

    $ tito tag -u

.. NOTE:: During developing, we could also generate test build any time, which will be based on current `HEAD` instead of latest tag.

  ::

    # generate test builds
    $ tito build --test --tgz/srpm/rpm

Push
````

When you're happy with your build, it's time to push commit and tag to remote.

::

    $ git push origin && git push origin <your_tag>

Release
```````

So that user could install `demo` packages after enable the repo. [#]_

 .. NOTE:: Before doing any release, make sure that you have account on both sites and also make sure that you could
  access to your fedorapeople space [#]_ and have enough permissions [#]_ to build `demo` in `Copr`.

  You need to create a directory called `demo_srpms/` under your fedorapeople space `public_html/` to hold all the uploaded
  srpms.

  `copr-cli` will be used, installed by `sudo yum/dnf install copr-cli` and configure it. [#]_

Currently there are two projects in `Copr`: `demo` for all tag based releases and `demo-test` for test builds. We have two
release targets in `tito`, `copr-demo` is for `demo` in `Copr` and `copr-demo-test` is for `demo-test` respectively.

Request as `Builder` for projects `demo/demo-test` and `demo/demo`, wait until admin approves.

After all setup, release with `tito`::

    $ tito release copr-demo
    # or
    $ tito release copr-demo-test

Go and grab a cup of tea or coffee, the release build will be come out soon ::

    # test builds: `https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/demo/demo-test/builds/`
    # tag based builds: `https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/demo/demo/builds/`
